# asSWFbit Library #

## Description ##
asSWFbit\_Library is a ActionScript based SWF Decompiler / Compiler for SWF files.
The library should help you to check, test and manipulate SWF files in any way you wanted.
The idea behind asSWFbit is to make it possible to provide a way fix small errors in a SWF file without needing a flash editor or the FLA files.
I hope you understand you should this only do for your own SWF files !
